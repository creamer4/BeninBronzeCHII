                        <p class="header"><b>A Brief History of the Benin Bronzes at the Broad </b></p>
                        <p class="body">Museums are coming under greater scrutiny when addressing the provenance of the objects in their collections. More and more, museums are repatriating or being called to repatriate artifacts to their home countries and communities. Perhaps the most publicized repatriations in recent years are that of the Benin Bronzes, with museums like the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African Art and the Horniman Museum in London returning 29 and 72 Bronzes respectively.
                        </p>
                        <p class="body">The artifacts commonly known as the “Benin Bronzes” are a collection of several thousand bronze pieces that were forcibly taken from the Kingdom of Benin. In 1987 British armed forces launched a punitive expedition against the Royal Palace in Benin, resulting in the horrific massacre of those living in Benin City. It is during this retaliatory expedition that many of the bronzes pieces were looted and taken to the British Museum. Today, some 900 bronze pieces from Benin are accessioned and housed in the British Museum, with hundreds more accessioned in museums around the world.
                        </p>
                        <p class="body">The Broad Art Museum at Michigan State University ran the exhibition History Told Slant: 77 Years of Collecting Art at MSU from January to August of 2022. HTS was a retrospective and introspective of the museum’s holdings and aimed to “tell all the truth but tell it slant” through a critical conversation about the role art museums have played in the promotion of white supremacy in what they have chosen to collect and display. It was here that several bronze statue pieces from Benin were displayed, many for the first time since the 1960s or 1970s.
                        <p class="body">Given the controversial and violent history of the Benin Bronzes, provenance research using MSU’s archives and special collections was done to determine how the museum obtained the pieces. The pieces were purchased and accessioned in the 1960s into what was known at the time as the Kresge Museum, now the Broad Art Museum. John Hannah became interested in Nigerian artwork during his trips to the country to work with the USAID/MSU joint project developing a university in Nigeria. The pieces were purchased by Arthur Hannah on behalf of his brother John Hannah, who was the president of MSU at the time of purchase. After the over 100 pieces were purchased, the were exported from Nigeria under suspicious circumstances. Although there is no “proof” that the objects were exported illegally, John Hannah and his affiliates were aware of the laws prohibiting the exportation of Nigerian Antiquities. In their various correspondence, it becomes
                        clear that there was conspiracy to commit fraud through the illicit exportation of the objects, and if official export permits were obtained, those permits have not yet been found in the archive.
                        </p>
                        <p class="body">However, despite the suspicious circumstances under which the object entered the country, there is a significant likelihood that the objects are not authentic bronzes. If the pieces are in fact modern sculptures that were intended to look like antiquities, then there would not have been any laws broken importing them to the United States. This assessment of forgery is based on a visual assessment of the patina on the objects as well as certain other physical attributes. Further corroborating this assessment is the unlikelihood that the Hannahs would have been able to find such a large number of authentic bronzes. A compositional alloy analysis could provide further evidence to suggest the authenticity of the pieces.
