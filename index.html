                                <p class="body">It has long been acknowledged that Western museums, historically, have benefited from colonialism and imperialism. Museum collections, particularly anthropological and archaeological collections, are filled with objects acquired through colonialism. Given this history, museums need to critically examine the provenance, or record of ownership and acquisition, in their collection’s objects. Such research can provide information about the legality and ethics of object ownership, as well as result in the return or reframing of individual objects currently held in museums. One such case of provenance investigation was recently conducted at Michigan State University’s Broad Art Museum. All objects investigated remain in the collection, yet their history is better understood and the way the museum will display them going forward has been irrevocably changed.
                                As museums are beginning to address and untangle their historic and continued role in and benefits from colonialism, many are more seriously examining the provenance of the objects in their collections. Importantly, museums are now evaluating legal versus ethical collecting practices; for example, whether something previously collected legally has an ethical place in their collection. This reflection has manifested itself largely in repatriation efforts, where objects of cultural significance are being returned to groups exerting cultural ownership of those objects. Not all repatriation projects began internally, but rather came about from external pressure of groups and communities advocating for the return their cultural patrimony. Perhaps the most well-known and publicized example of repatriation projects resulting from public pressure is that of the Parthenon Marbles, also known as the Elgin Marbles (Janzekovic, 2016). These marbles are a collection of pieces taken from the Parthenon in the early 1800s by the Earle of Elgin and now reside in the British Museum in London (Hitchens et al, 1997; Merryman, 2009). The removal of the Marbles was a result of alleged approval of the Ottoman Empire, the ruling body in Greece at the time. However, that claim has been disputed, calling into question the legality of their removal. In addition to the disputed legality, activists in support of their return assert that Greece has a cultural and ethical claim to the objects with their rightful home in the Acropolis Museum in Athens. As of now, the Marbles have not been returned, and are still on display in the British Museum.
                                </p>

                                <p class="body">	While the bid for repatriation of the Parthenon Marbles has been unsuccessful, there are many cases of successful repatriation. In the last few years, because of growing public and governmental pressure, several museums have returned their collection of Benin Bronzes to Nigeria (Hicks, 2020; Wood, 2012). The “Benin Bronzes” refers to several thousand bronze sculptures and plaques that were looted from the Kingdom of Benin’s royal palace in 1897. The looting of these objects was the result of a British expedition in the Kingdom of Benin as a show of imperial authority over the area. During that colonial campaign, the British troops launched a punitive attack on the royal palace, which resulted in a massacre. Following this bloody and violent attack, the city was plundered, and many cultural objects were looted. Many were taken to the British Museum with the rest sold to both private and museum collections around the world (Hicks, 2020; Phillips, 2021). Nigeria has been seeking the return or repatriation of the Bronzes since gaining its independence in 1960. While some pieces have been sold to the Nigerian government, only recently have Western museums begun returning the pieces they held in their collection. Most notably, the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology at Cambridge, the Smithsonian Museum, and the Horniman Museum in London all repatriated the Benin Bronzes in their collections. The British Museum has not returned any of the objects in their collection, and has the largest collection of bronzes of any museum.
                                </p>

                                <p class="body">	In 2023, the Broad Art Museum (BAM) of Michigan State University (MSU) in East Lansing opened their exhibit History Told Slant: Seventy-Seven Years of Collecting Art at MSU. This exhibition was a retrospective which explored the museum’s entire collection, and the influence and broader themes that shaped the museum’s collecting practices and scope of the collection. The BAM explained that “the exhibition breaks with conventions of the western art historical canon in order to acknowledge gaps and fissures within the collection.” (BAM, 2023). Displayed in the exhibition were several bronze sculptures which were labeled by the museum as being pieces from Nigeria from the mid to late 19th century. Knowing that this fits the timeline for the controversial “Benin Bronzes”, a provenance project was undertaken to determine the circumstance under which the objects were collected, to ensure the legality and ethics of having the pieces in the collection.
                                	In 1958, Michigan State University’s President John Hannah and Dr. Glen Taggart, Dean of the International Programs at MSU joined the United State Agency for International Development (USAID) in Nigeria for a survey of Nsukka, evaluating a proposed establishment of a new university (Ross, 1966; Ukariwe, 1984). It was recommended that the proposed university receive global resources and support, and in 1960 the University of Nigeria formally opened. For the greater part of the next decade, MSU played a crucial role in the development and support of the University, providing nearly 150 short and long-term personnel as well as financial support. This collaborative project required that John Hannah make many trips to Nigeria before and during the establishment of the university. While there, he developed an interest in Nigerian art and artifacts. A letter sent June 10th, 196 3 by Dr. George Axinn, then-coordinator of the Nigeria-MSU Program, to John Hannah referenced Hannah’s indicated interest in obtaining Nigerian artifacts on behalf of MSU. That same letter explained that if Hannah was still interested, Mr. Axinn recommended that Dr. Joseph Druse, professor of History and Humanities at MSU and advisor in Nigeria, be authorized to spend $1,000 during his summer trip through the country. Following a letter from Hannah on June 19th that confirmed he wanted the art purchased, a telegraph sent by Axinn on June 27th, 1963, officially authorized Druse to be eligible to be reimbursed by Charles “Bud” Doane, International Programs staff with the Nigeria-MSU project, for up to $1,000 for the purchase of Nigerian art.
                                	Due in part to the history of imperial-based looting by Western countries, many countries enacted antiquities laws in their countries which restrict the purchase, sale, and export of cultural patrimony (CCC). While countries defined objects of cultural significance differently, and had different restrictions and legal requirements, the goal was the same: preventing unchecked removal of cultural patrimony from their country. Nigeria passed its first such law in 1953. The law, known as the Antiquities Ordinance No. 17, created the National Department of Antiquities and the Antiquities Commission (Uwakwe & Nwoke, 2020). Following Ordinance No. 17, Nigeria created Antiquities Regulations in 1957, which required permits for the export of antiquities and cultural materials (Eboreime, 1995; Uwakwe & Nwoke, 2020). Limited primary documents relating to the original 1953 Antiquities Ordinance are available online. However, language for the later Decree No. 77 in 1979 seems to suggest that the Ordinance was the foundational language for defining antiquities. Decree 77 defined antiquities as “(a) any object of archaeological interest or land in which any such object is believed to exist or was discovered, or; (b) any relic of early European settlement or colonization, (c) any work of art or craftwork including any statue, modelled clay figure, cast or wrought in metal, carving, housepost, ornament, utensil, weapon, armour, regalia, manuscript, or document if such work of art or craft work is of indigenous origin, and; (d) was made or fashioned before 1918 (the period of the Great Influenza epidemic), or; (e) is of historical, artistic or scientific interest, and is or has been used at any time in the performance and for the purpose of any traditional African ceremony” (Eboreime, 1995). While this indicates there was opportunities for the legal export of artifacts from Nigeria to MSU, archival evidence suggests that was not the case.
                                </p>

                                <p class="body">During the 1960s, Dr. Kenneth Dike was the head of the Antiquities Commission and would have been the issuer of all export permits for antiquities at the time. In a letter from Druse to Axinn, written August 26th, 1963, Druse expresses concern about exporting the pieces, citing that “there is much to-do in the process currently concerning the export of antiquities”. In Axinn’s responding letter, penned September 5th, he references that Dr. Dike had not yet been contacted, and that Druse should be careful about his art selections (1963). The most damning letter, however, is from John Hannah to Philip May, Vice President for Business and Finance at MSU, where he suggests that the artifacts may be shipped out of the country in small batches, as not to raise suspicion. He goes on to explain that “the Nigerian Government [that] is now discouraging the export of Benin art and would rather keep them for their own museums.” (1964). The evidence from all the correspondence at that point suggests that not only was this group aware of the laws prohibiting the export of these items, and the Nigerian Government’s official position about keeping artifacts in the country, but they also aimed to remove the objects from the country without proper documentation or the government’s approval. There is no evidence that Dr. Dike was ever contacted by Hannah, or that export paperwork was filed. Shipping and customs correspondence further supports this, as there are letters from customs agents in Michigan to Jack Jackson, an administrative officer for the University of Nigeria and MSU, citing that paperwork was improperly filled out and labeled. Specifically, that those in Nigeria reported a small handful of objects to customs, between 5 and 15, and when the objects arrived at the customs office in Muskegon, there was closer to 100 pieces in the shipment (1963). Despite several attempts from customs to get full and correct documentation on the objects, the customs officials were never sent full reports on the number, type, and value of the objects. Jackson writes in a letter to Doane that the items were eventually cleared when he called the customs bureau and explained he “didn’t have the slightest idea how the extra items got into the shipment”, but he explained they were all going to the [MSU] museum. Customs found this explanation to be satisfactory and released the items without ever receiving the full documentation.
                                </p>

                                <p class="body">This case study offers an excellent opportunity to explore legal versus ethical object acquisition, as well as what it means for a museum object to be “authentic”. As evidenced in the primary sources, these artifacts seemed to be removed from Nigeria illegally. There were laws in place that prohibited the export of art and artifacts from the country without proper authorization, and those involved with the purchase and transport of the bronzes clearly were aware of those laws, and ignored them, going as far as to deceive customs willingly and strategically. However, it is highly unlikely that all the artifacts, which numbered nearly 100 pieces, were “authentic” bronzes, and it is considerably more probable that the majority, if not all, of the objects were contemporary reproductions that may have been marketed as true antiquities. If that is true, then the objects were not technically removed from the country illegally. There were no laws prohibiting the purchase and export of contemporary arts and crafts, and John Hannah removing modern art pieces from the country would have been permissible under the law, regardless of his understanding of the authenticity of the pieces. However, if these pieces were in fact not removed illegally, they were certainly removed unethically. John Hannah and the others involved clearly believed that what they were doing was illegal, and even if that was not truly the case, their behavior was still unethical, and the museum’s acceptance of trafficked items is also unethical. Now knowing this provenance, the Broad Art Museum has the opportunity to reflect on the philosophy of their collecting and exhibition policies and strategies and have the chance to create a precedent for how the communicate contentious pieces in their collection. At this time, it has been recommended that the BAM conduct alloy composition analysis on the pieces, as there is evidence to suggest that atomic absorption spectrometry and environmental scanning electron microscopy testing can successfully determine whether the bronzes were produced during the correct time period, or are modern productions (Simon & Rohrs, 2018).
                                Additionally, as recently as 2023, the museum displayed these objects and labelled them as if they were true antiquities. Even though a previous curator, Dr. Raymond Silverman, indicated they may have been modern reproductions and forgeries after a visual assessment of a small subset of the objects, they continued to be labelled as “real” both in the BAM’s digital database and in exhibitions. In a 2020 report by Wilkening Consulting Trust and Museums, museums were reported as one of the most trustworthy sources of information, with 81% of people surveyed responding that museums were credible sources of information. Because of this, museums have a great deal of power in influencing public perception and knowledge of a topic or object. If they provide information or context in an exhibit, the public is likely to accept that information as fact. And why wouldn’t they? Museums are staffed by people who have worked for years to become experts in their field. So, when a museum displays an item as “real” or “authentic”, does that item not take on some sort of authenticity? Museums have a responsibility to ensure, as much as possible, that the information they convey is correct. The irony is not lost that an exhibit curated to explore the role museum collecting practices have played in creating Western canon ended up displaying forgeries that were smuggled into the country and labelled as authentic by powerful Western men.
